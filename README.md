# AtmSimulationSystem
The ATM Simulation System was my first Java project, built with teammates using Java Swing and OOP. It simulates core ATM functions where customers can log in with account number and PIN to deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balances, and view mini statements, while admins can create, update, search accounts, and view transaction history.
